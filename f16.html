<BODY>
  <p class="p1"> F-16s were the first planes to use fly by wire.
    F-16s were first made by general dynamics which is now lockheed martin. F-16s have only one engine and they have the engine intake under the fuselage of the f-16.
    F-16s have a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility and an seat reclined 30 degrees to reduce g-forces.</p>
