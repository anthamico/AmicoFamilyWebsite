    F-16s were first made by general dynamics which is now lockheed martin. F-16s have only one engine and they have the engine intake under the fuselage of the f-16.
    F-16s have a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility and an seat reclined 30 degrees to reduce g-forces. It was built to do 9-g maneuvers. It has an aerial refueling receptacle behind the cockpit. There is a fairing belolow the rudder that usually has ECM equipment or a drag chute. It is designed to be slightly aerodynamicly unstable.
